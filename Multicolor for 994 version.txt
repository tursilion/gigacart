Multicolor is 1536 bytes per screen (full)
Dragon's Lair, packed, is ~80MB (~48MB free!)

10855 frames
Bitmap frames are 6144 bytes + 1544 bytes = 7688 bytes = 83,453,240 bytes
But IIRC I cheat and do 8192 bytes per frame (one bank), so 88,924,160 bytes or 84MB (exactly)
Waste is 504 bytes per frame, 5,470,920 bytes total.

Free space is 44MB, then.

In multicolor mode, a frame at the same frame rate would be 1536 + 1544 = 3080 bytes.
There's enough space for 14,979 multicolor frames. 

If we doubled the framerate (but not the audio), it would be 1536*2+1544 = 4616 bytes.
That has space for 9,995 frames (original rate) at double the frame rate. At 9 frames per second (original rate), we'd have to trim 860 frames, 95 seconds, which is a fair bit.

But we could drop the mirrored rooms? That's:
Ropes:  217 frames
Horse:  270 frames
Smithy: 347 frames
Wizard: 308 frames
Crypt:  264 frames
Knight: 280 frames
Pond:   371 frames
------------------
       2057 frames of mirrored data

Hmm. But so far, multicolored images of DL look really bad. Try adding dither to the converter.
