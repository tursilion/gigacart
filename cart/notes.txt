It is probably possible to fit everything into a normal sized TI cartridge.

If you put the CF card connector at right-angles to the cart, it exactly fits on one side from the hole to the very edge of the cart.
You can run traces underneath, but no components. Everything needs to the around the hole and to the other side of the PCB.
We'd have to add the circuitry that the CF to IDE adapter uses, but I think the only components are the resistor and LED for activity.

If you are willing to hack up a 2MB cart with two EPROMs, we should be able to construct a simple piggy-back hack to get all 4MB working. We'll need an additional banking chip, the additional EPROM, of course, and a couple of wires. We'll also have to lift a pin (or cut a trace) to the EPROM on the bottom.

I'm thinking we might get away with using one of the old 74LS378's for the second banking chip... which is nice because it has both inverted and non-inverted outputs. That means we get both EPROM selects in one. ;)

I'd like to prove it out, but right now I don't know where my PCBs are, or my EPROMs, or my programmer (although I will need to search for them soon ;) ), and I'm not sure my 16-bit programmer is working. But what I am envisioning is something like this (writing it down for my own memory as well ;) ):

Start with a standard 2MB board. Two 27C160s (that's the one we are using, right?), one 74LS377 (the 2MB banking chip) and one 74LS379 (the original 16-64k banking chip). Bend out pin 14 on both EPROMs (!G - normally runs to a big ground trace on the board). This is the chip's output enable - we normally forced it on, but now we'll switch on it instead. Install to the board and piggy back all pins except the bent out ones.

The chip on the bottom should have the first half of the 4MB image, and the chip on the top will get the second half.

Install the 377 normally. Connect short wires to pins 10 and 11.

On the 379, bend out all the pins except 1 and 16 (Enable and Vcc). Connect pins 5, 12 and 13 to pin 8 (ground) - this just locks down the unused inputs. Attach wires to pins 2,3 and 4 long enough to reach to the EPROMs.

Line them up with the notched end of the 377 and solder down. Connect the short wires on the 377 to pins 8 and 9 on the 379 (that is, 377's pin 10 (gnd) to 379's pin 8 (gnd), and 377's pin 11 (CP) to 379's pin 9 (CP)). They match up on the correct sides but are off by two since the 379 is shorter. Since no other pins are connected, a drop of glue to hold it to the 377 wouldn't hurt ;)

Connect the wire from the 379's pin 4 (D0) to the the EPROMs pin 43 (A19). This pulls the TI's A6, which is the next address bit for banking. This pin is attached through both EPROMs.

Connect the wire from the 379's pin 3 (!Q0) to the top EPROM's bent out pin 14. This selects the top EPROM when a write with A6 high is set (and deselects the bottom one).

Connect the wire from the 379's pin 2 (Q0) to the bottom EPROM's bent out pin 14. This does the inverse.

In theory... that's all it takes.
